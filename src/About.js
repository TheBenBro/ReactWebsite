        <p>I have graduated Humber college for game programming. I've had a passion for video games, and programming since high school, so i decided to pursue the gaming industry. I currently have knowledge in Unreal Engine, Unity, C++, and C#. During my time at Humber I have learned how to work in a group, and how to manage my time well.</p>
